Hey everyone. My name is Stephen Ajulu. I am the founder and lead writer of Ajulu’s Thoughts.

I am also an Tech Consultant, Front End Web Developer(and Designer), Student, Researcher and Cybersecurity Enthusiast. I have founded/co-founded several companies i.e. OwlSec Technologies, Quevant e-Store, Alusa SS Investment, Biom.me among others.

I created this blog because 1) I’ve always had a passion for learning 2) I have always loved sharing knowledge and teaching others 3) I wanted to build my personal brand
