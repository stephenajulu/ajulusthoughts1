# My Name is Stephen Ajulu and This is the Source Code of my Blog: https://blog.stephenajulu.com

I am currently using Hugo Novela ported by Forestry.io from Narative's Gatbsy Version.

I have customized it to my linking and will continue to do so until i achieve my version of perfection.

Currently am planning to copy posts from my official blog https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com 

For those interested in my version go ahead and fork this. I am still working on it and have about 7 things to do.

I have and will contine to document my process in both my blogs, on medium, dev.to and syndicate to to other blogs.

The reason i chose static is because of it's speed and security. As of this day (5th April 2020) PageSpeed Desktop Score was 100 while mobile was 99.
I am yet to implement a csr but if you fork it please do. 

If you do fork this make sure your image formats are in .webp and do a gtmetrics.com scan one of the post with the largest image(1920x1080 or 1900x600), if they say resize/scale take that no {the size you should implement} and do that for the rest of the images eg for mine the image was 1600x900 they told me to resize it to 675x600 so i resized all the images to 875x800) Why do this to make the blog faster.

I also implemented a service worker, icons and manifest file so you'll need to change that, feel free to use https://pwastarter.love2dev.com it takes less than 5 minutes and you'll have all the htings you need to make the website a progressive web application meaining it will work offline.

For more info kindly chech the series on both blogs.

Also note i added comments through utterances. It uses github issues as a comment base.

</a>

### Prerequisites

- Hugo > 0.55.0

### Content Management

![Forestry user interface](images/novela-forestry.png)

This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io), just import your repository âœ¨. \
Any changes you make will be commited back to the repo, and deployed if you're using Netlify.

### Deployment and hosting with Netlify

Import your site in [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

1. Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.
2. Set the build command to: `hugo --gc --minify`
3. Set the publish directory to: `public`
4. Make sure to set `HUGO_VERSION` to 0.55.0 or above (tested with 0.62.2)
3. Set the publish directory to: `public`

That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on `git push` or when saving documents from Forestry.

### Development

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:forestryio/novela-hugo-starter.git

# cd in the project directory
cd novela-hugo-starter

# Start local dev server
hugo server
```
